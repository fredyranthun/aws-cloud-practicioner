# EC2

## Budget Setup

- Use root account
- Define a budget and alarm for the budget
- Administrator access has no permission to do it.
- IAM and role access to Billing information - activate
- AWS Budgets -> can create alarms with templates.
- E.g.: Zero spend budget -> alarm will show you when you spend more than 1 cent.
- Monthly cost Budget -> get emails when spending gets 85%, forecast gets to 100%.

## EC2 Instances

- Elastic Compute Cloud
- IaaS
- Renting virtual Machines - EC2
- Storing data on virtual drive - EBS
- Distributing loads across machines - ELB
- Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group - ASG
- Fundamental to understand how Cloud works

## EC2 Sizing and configuration options

- OS: Linux, Windows or MacOS
- How much compute power: CPU
- How much RAM
- How much storage space:
  - Network-attached EBS & EFS
  - hardware (EC2 Instance store)
- Network Card: speed, Public IP address
- Firewall rules: security group
- Bootstrap script: EC2 User Data

## EC2 User Data

- A script that runs once at the instance first start
- Automate boot tasks (bootstraping), launching commands when a machine starts
- Install updates, install software, download common files from the internet
- Runs with the root user (sudo)

## EC2 Instances Types

- family.size
- E.g.: t2.micro, t2,xlarge, c5d.4xlarge
- different sizes for the same family
- t2.micro is part of AWS free tier

## Launching a Instance

- Web server launched with EC2 User Data
- Start / stop / terminate instance
- Create Name and Tag (tags are optional)
- Base Image -> OS and predefined image for the instance (architecture)
- Create a key pair to access the instance (.pem for linux, .ppk for Windows previous than 10)
- Network settings
  - Public IP (Auto-assign)
  - Allow SSH traffic from anywhere
  - allow http traffic from internet
- Storage -> default 8 GiB
- Volume will be deleted on termination by default
- Advanced details:
  - User Data: script for being execute on first launch
  - Example:
  ```shell
    yum update -y
    yum install -y httpd
    systemctl start httpd
    systemctl enable httpd
    echo "<h1>Hello World from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
  ```
- Summary: information about the instance we are launching
- It takes less then one minute to launch the instance
- You can access via the public IP of the instance, which is accessible from internet
- Stop state -> will not charge
- Terminate instance -> will destroy all data related by default

## EC2 Instance Types

- Different types for different use cases
- m5.2xlarge
  - m is the instance class
  - 5 is the generation
  - 2xlarge - size inside the class
- Types of instances:
  - General Purpose - great for a diversity of workloads, as web servers, code repositories,
    balance between compute, memory, networking. Eg: t2.micro
  - Compute Optimized - great for compute intensive tasks (batch processing, media transcoding,
    high performance web servers, high performance computing - HPC, scientific modeling and machine learning,
    dedicated gaming servers) - Eg.: C5, C6
  - Memory optimized - fast performance for large data sets in memory - high performance, relational/non-relational data bases, distributed web scale cache stores, BI, real-time processing of big unstructured data
  - Storage Optimized - storage-intensive tasks require high sequencial read and write access to large data sets
  - and others

## Security Groups

- They are the fundamental of network security in AWS.
- Control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 Instances
- Contain only ALLOW rules
- Security group rules can reference by IP or by security group
- E.g.: security group on EC2 instance, allowing inbound traffic and outbound traffic so we can access the instance from our machine
- Acting as firewall on EC2 instances
- They regulate:
  - Access to ports
  - Authorized IP ranges - IPv4 and IPv6
  - Control of inbound network
  - Control of outbound network
  - Type, Protocol, Port Range, Source, Description
- E.g.: allow my instance to be accessed from my IP on port 22 (ssh). Other computers will be blocked.
- By default, all outbound traffic is allowed (any IP and any port)
- Security groups can be attached to multiple instances
- Instances can have multiple security groups
- Loocked down to a region /VPC combination
- Security groups live outside the EC2 - if traffic is blocked the EC2 instance will not see it.
- Good to mantain separate security group for SSH access.
- Timeout to access is probably security group issue
- Default:
  - all inbound traffic is blocked
  - all outbound traffic is authorized
- Security group can reference/ authorize other Security groups
- So the EC2 instances attached to the authorized security groups will be able allowed to access the initial instance
- This way there is no need to hardcode Instance IPs

## Ports to know

- 22 - SSH - secure shell
- 21 - FTP
- 22 - SFTP - upload files using SSH
- 80 - http - access unsecured websites
- 443 - https - access secure websites
- 3389 - RDP - Remote Desktop Protocol - log into a Windows Instance

## Inbound rules

- allow connection from the internet
- IP 0.0.0.0/0 allow connections from every IP
- You can allow access from other security groups

## SSH

- Connect to Linux instances
- Command line interface utility (Linux, Mac, Windows)
- On Windows can use Putty
- EC2 Instance Connect - web browser in any OS
- To connect with the instance via ssh:

```shell
  ssh -i ./EC2-tutorial.pem ec2-user@machine-ip
```

- the .pem file needs to have its permissions changed before connection
- ec2-user is the created user for ssh connections

## EC2 Instance Connect

- Alternative to SSH
- Click connect on Instance console

## EC2 Instance Roles

- When attach a role to a instance, we can use AWS CLI to access the permitted commands
- The command is working

## EC2 Instances Purchasing Options

- On-Demand - short workload, predictable pricing, pay by second
- Reserved (1 and 3 years) - Reserved Instances - long workloads
- Convertible Reserverd Instances
- Saving Plans - 1 and 3 years - amount of usage
- Spot Instances - less reliable
- Dedicated Hosts
- Dedicated Instances
- Capacity Reservation - reserve capacity in AZ for any duration

### On Demand

- Linux or Windows - billing per second after first minute
- Other - billing per hour
- Highest cost but no upfront payment
- no long-term commitment
- Short term and un-interrupted workloads

### Reserved Instances

- Up to 72% discount compared to On-demand
- Reserve a specific instance attributes (instance type, Region, Tenancy, OS)
- Reservation period - 1 year (+discount) or 3 years (+++discount)
- No upfront (+), partial upfront (++), all upfront (+++)
- steady usage applications (database)
- you can buy and sell in marketplace if you do not need it anymore
- Convertible Reserved Instance
  - can change EC2 instance type, family, OS, scope and tenancy
  - litlle less discount

### EC2 Saving plans

- Discount based on long-term usage
- commit to a certain type of usage (10$ per hour for 1 or 3 years)
- usage beyond EC2 Saving plans is billet at on-demand price
- locked to specific instance family and AWS Region(t2 in us-east-1)
- Flexible across: instance size, OS, Tenancy

### EC2 Spot Instances

- up to 90% discount
- you can lose at any point of time, if your max price is less than the current price
- Most cost-efficient instances in AWS
- workload resilient to failure (batch jobs, data analysis, image processing, distributed jobs)

### Dedicated Hosts

- physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use
- compliance requirements and use existing server-bound software licenses.
- purchasing options
  - On demand
  - Reserved
- the most expensive
- Use Case: Complicated licensing model
- for companies that have strongly regulatory or compliance needs
- access the host itself, visibility of the hardware

### Dedicated Instances

- On hardware dedicated to you
- Share hardware with other instances in same account
- no control over instance placement (can move hardware after stop/start)

### EC2 Capacity Reservations

- Reserver On-Demand instances capacity in specific AZ
- no time commitment, no billing discounts
- charged at on-demand rate whether you run your instances or not
- suitable for short-term, uninterrupted workloads that needs to be in a specific AZ.

## Shared Responsibility

- AWS - infrastructure, isolation on physical host, replace faulty hardware, compliance validation
- You - security group rules, operating system patches and updates, sofware and utilities on the EC2 instance, IAM Roles assigned to EC2 and IAM user access management, Data security on your instance

## Summary

- EC2 Instance - AMI (OS) + Instance Size (CPU + RAM) + Storage + security groups + EC2 User Data
- Security Groups - Firewall attached to the EC2 instance
- EC2 User data - script executed in the first launch
- ssh - connect to the instance via terminal - port 22
- EC2 Instance Role - link to IAM roles
- Different purchase options
